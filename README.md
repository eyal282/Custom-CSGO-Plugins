# Selling-CSGO-private-plugins
If you wanna buy a plugin I made for CSGO feel free to contact me on steam: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198059282016/

If you use Allied-Modders this is my account there: https://forums.alliedmods.net/member.php?u=152421

I can script for pay as well if I am not busy.

I'm selling three plugins, two of which exist in Counter Strike 1.6 and therefore are detailed:


1.  JailBreak Last Request which is very custom and on a technical level there are around 2000+ different last requests you can start.

Note: The JailBreak Last Request outweighs every single existing JailBreak plugin if you don't like glowing sh**. A player can decide rules, like HS or not, bunnyhop or not, crouch and jump or not, vest helmet or not and etc... Shot 4 Shot is built that cheating is impossible. Suicide is impossible as well, but it will still damage and kill you. The Last Request has First Writes, Combo Contest, Math Contest, noclip knife duel, invisible knife duel ( the non-invisible / noclip player gets m4a1 ) and many more.

2. Gun-XP, Gun-XP is a plugin that exists on Counter Strike 1.6 but I made it for CS:GO too, here's the 1.6 version: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=802294

Note that I have Prestige system attached to the Gun-XP but I can remove it if you want.

3. Gas Nades, also a 1.6 plugin which can be found in the following link, it makes smoke grenades choke you: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=532225 

Note: Despite the fact that gas nades should bypass armour, I didn't make it but if you buy the plugin and want it I can add it for you.

You can send me offers
